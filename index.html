                    Hello, my name is Julius i am quite passionate about software development thats complemented with his exceptional problem solving skills.
                    My journey in software development started back in 2017 when I visited a friend in their office and found them writing code, during our 
                    discussion I asked him what it takes to be a programmer and he told me you just have to start, and that when i wrote my first html code that we all know about 
                    <code>"Hello world"</code> That exitment of seeing that text on my browser drove me into wanting to learn more and do more with programming. With my
                    thirst to find solutions to problems, programming just got more and more interesting day by day. Looking forward to tackle more real life problems with the keyboard stroke.
                    A fast learner too who adopts quickly to changing dynamics and focuses on results to getting things done.
